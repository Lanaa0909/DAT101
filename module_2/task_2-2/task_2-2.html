      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Constants should be used for values that remain unchanged throughout the program.
         Their name reflects their purpose: they are constant and should not be modified. 
         In contrast, variables are designed for storing data that may need to be updated or altered later. 
         Not all values should be constants, as future changes in the code may require flexibility in data storage. ]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[When using parentheses, it enables that whatever is inside this should be calculated first,
        it also ensures it from not mixing with other numbers if there is for example a math equation.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[You can use toFixed() method, and put a number in the parentheses, which will limit the number based 
        on what is written there.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[You can use a tolerance level to account for precision errors. Instead of checking for direct equality,
        we can check if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than a small epsilon value.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators return a boolean value, which is true or false. 
        You can check their results directly in conditions or by storing them in a variable.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[The function generates a random number between a number that you are providing it.
        It can be used for generating random numbers, shuffling, and creating random selections in general.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation.
        It is useful when you want to determine wether a number is even or odd.
        You can also use it when you need to limit a range.]
