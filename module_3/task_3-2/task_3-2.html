      <li>[1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?

        Yes, you could use one for loop by counting up to 10 and then down, but using two loops makes it easier to read.]</li>

      <p>[2. In part 2, can we create an "infinite" loop in the "while" condition?

        Yes, we can! If we use while (true), it will loop forever unless we add a break to stop it when we guess right. So, we need some condition or it will not stop.]</p>

      <p>[3. How fast can a computer make these guesses? Does it do other tasks while guessing?

        It is fast, especially for small ranges. With bigger numbers, it might take longer but still guesses quickly. While it is in the loop, it is only focused on guessing and cannot do other tasks unless we code it to ]</p>

      <p>[4. How do rows and columns work in nested "for" loops? Can we switch them?

        Yes, you can switch them. If rows are the outer loop and columns are inner, it goes across columns for each row. Switching them flips the order, but both ways make a grid.]</p>
