      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[In Part 1, if my wakeUpTime is exactly 7, the program says , "I can take the buss to school". But if I wake up at any other time (like 6 or 8), it doesn't print that, which means I miss the buss, therefore it is pretty clear that waking up at 7 is the best opton to catch the buss.  ]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[In Part 2, the program still checks for 7 but adds an alternative. If I wake up at 7, I get the buss message. If it is not 7, it tells me "I have to take the car to school". So, now there is a consequence for missing the buss, I have to drive instead.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[Part 3 adds a new check for waking up at 8. If I wake up at 7, I still get to take the buss. If I wake up at 8, it says, "I can take the train to school". For times less than 7 or greater than 8, I still end up having to take the car. So it gives me more options based on when I wake up.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[In Part 4, the program checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is 0, it simply prints "Zero". This shows that zero is not a positive or negative; it is its own thing. So, when I test for 0, it is clear that it is neutral. ]</p>
