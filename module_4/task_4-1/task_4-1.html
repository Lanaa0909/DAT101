      [1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming ?
      <p>Object-oriented development helps organize code by grouping data and functions together into objects, making it easier to reuse, maintain, and scale]</li>
      <p>[2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.
       <p>The "AccountType" object stores different account types. It helps by keeping values in one place, making the code easier to update and manage.]</p>
      <p>[3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.
        <p>Encapsulation hides data to protect it from being changed directly. We use private members (e.g., #) to hide data, and public members to access or modify it.]</p>
      <p>[4.Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript. 
        </p>The new command creates a new instance of an object from a class or constructor function and sets this to that new object.]</p>
